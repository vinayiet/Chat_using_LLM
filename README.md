# README: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for QA Bot

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot, utilizing Pinecone as the vector database and Cohere's API for text generation. The QA bot retrieves relevant information from a dataset and generates coherent answers.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a QA bot that combines retrieval-based and generative approaches. By leveraging Pinecone's vector database, the bot efficiently retrieves relevant documents, and using Cohere's language models, it generates accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## Setup

1. **Install Required Libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install pinecone-client sentence-transformers cohere
   ```

2. **Initialize Pinecone**:

   ```python
   from pinecone import Pinecone

   pc = Pinecone(api_key="your_pinecone_api_key")
   index = pc.Index("quickstart")
   ```

3. **Load the Embedding Model**:

   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

   model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   ```

4. **Initialize Cohere API**:

   ```python
   import cohere

   cohere_client = cohere.Client("your_cohere_api_key")
   ```

## Data Preparation

Prepare your dataset by compiling documents that the QA bot will reference. For each document, generate embeddings using the loaded model:

```python
documents = [
    "Pinecone is a vector database used for fast and scalable machine learning applications.",
    "Cohere is a platform that provides NLP models for various use cases like text generation.",
    "The capital of France is Paris."
]

embeddings = model.encode(documents)
```

## Model Training

No additional training is required for the pre-built models used in this project. Ensure that the models are properly loaded and the embeddings are correctly generated.

## Usage

Upsert the generated embeddings into the Pinecone index:

```python
for i, embedding in enumerate(embeddings):
    index.upsert(vectors=[(f"doc_{i}", embedding.tolist())])
```

Define the QA function that retrieves relevant documents and generates answers:

```python
def qa_bot(query):
    query_embedding = model.encode([query])[0]
    results = index.query(
        vector=query_embedding.tolist(),
        top_k=5,
        include_values=True,
        include_metadata=True
    )
    retrieved_docs = [result['id'] for result in results['matches']]
    answer = generate_answer(retrieved_docs, query)
    return answer
```

Implement the `generate_answer` function using Cohere's API:

```python
def generate_answer(retrieved_docs, query):
    context = " ".join(retrieved_docs)
    response = cohere_client.generate(
        prompt=f"{context}\n\nQuestion: {query}\nAnswer:",
        max_tokens=50
    )
    return response.generations[0].text.strip()
```

## Examples

```python
query = "What is Pinecone?"
answer = qa_bot(query)
print(f"Question: {query}\nAnswer: {answer}")
```

*Output:*

```
Question: What is Pinecone?
Answer: Pinecone is a vector database used for fast and scalable machine learning applications.
```
